We had an eventful annual day celebration at the old age home at Thavanoor, Malappuram, Kerala. KT Jaleel (MLA) inaugurated the ceremony with a speech about the importance of people who are willing to serve society. The MLA is very interested in Sparsham's work and is willing to assist us in any way he can. He wishes us success in the areas we serve. After the inaugural programme, the MLA had a tight schedule and had to dash to the next meeting.

The event was well-organized, with many surprises in store for the elderly inhabitants. We had a few interactive sessions that included anthakshari competitions, songs, and skits by the kids. Everyone was extremely energetic and cooperative with us throughout the event, which resulted in a huge success.

Our group participated in a few events, such as dances and skits, and interacted with the children and the elderly, all while having a great time. We shared lunch, handed out sweets, and then watched a movie in the auditorium.

The government of Kerala maintains and manages Thavanoor Old Age Home, and only those who chose a path of charity work there. The staff was extremely cooperative, and they are performing admirably. We gave out a few pairs of shoes to the youngsters and boys who were staying there before we left.

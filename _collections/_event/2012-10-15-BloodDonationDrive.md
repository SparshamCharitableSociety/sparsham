As part of our Gandhi Jayanthi celebrations, we held a blood donation drive at Ernakulam District Hospital. The event was held in collaboration with the Indian Red Cross Society and the District Hospital's Blood Bank. Prof. M. K. Sanoo inaugurated the event.

Malayalam author M. K. Sanu is a well-known personality in the Malayalam literary world. He is a retired professor, critic, biographer, editor, translator, journalist, orator, social activist, and humanist. He has written 36 novels, translated four, and edited 10 others. He is a permanent member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. He is also the founding member of Mithram, a school for the mentally handicapped in Mulanthuruthy village, Ernakulam District, Kerala.

The event was a success, and it was covered by a few local newspapers. Friends, colleagues, and others gathered, were made aware of the importance of blood donation after the session.

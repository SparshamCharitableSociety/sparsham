Sparsham celebrated Independence Day celebrations with the residents of Blind School, Aluva. We reached the school premises in the morning and had a flag-hosting ceremony. We then gave out sweets to the students and teachers. Interacting with them for the following few hours was a lot of fun. We were overjoyed to meet some exceptionally brilliant children who persevered in the face of adversity and grew stronger because of their experiences. We had an amazing experience, and they had had a fantastic time. We had lunch together and left the campus that afternoon.

We are pleased to announce that the students of GHSS Kamballur in Kasaragod, Kerala, would be our first beneficiaries.

We are celebrating our anniversary at Shanthi Bhavan, Opp. KSRTC Stand, Ernakulam. Shanthi Bhavan is a safe haven for women and girls. Many of those in this refuge have been subjected to various forms of torture and have been brought here by elected officials, law enforcement, or the courts. We are not permitted to take photographs or inquire about the people's identities. Be cautious.

The programme starts at 10 a.m. and ends at 4 p.m.

Programme schedule
10:00 a.m.: Interactive shows and games
12:00 p.m.: Present a computer to Shanthi Bhavan, as well as prizes to game winners.
01:00 p.m.: Lunch
02:00 p.m.: Movie screening
 
We thank our friend RJ Manu for coordinating and anchoring the event.

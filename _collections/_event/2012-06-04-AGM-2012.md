The Annual General Body Meeting took place in our office (AGM 2012). Since the commencement of our project, we've been discussing it. We developed an action plan for the 2012â€“13 fiscal year and made several critical decisions. The Executive Committee for the upcoming term was also unanimously chosen. In the future year, when we intend to extend our activities, we anticipate a lot of support and dedication from our members. We would like to express our gratitude to all the attendees at the AGM.

Sayuj Othayoth (Secretary)

Sparsham has launched the Prathibha Scholarships programme. We are conducting this scholarship exams for government schools and only the top candidates are awarded the scholarship money. The value of the scholarship varies depending on the class and the location of the school.

All the exams were based on the eighth, ninth, and tenth grade curriculum. Before the eligibility tests (Onam/Christmas Exams), the official notification will be released. Students who scored higher than the cutoff will be considered for Prathibha. The assessment will be based on each class's syllabus.

We collaborated with Nadavannur School's management, staff, and students to make this scholarship a huge success! We cordially invite all of our members to the Prathibha scholarship award ceremony on January 24, 2015 at 4 p.m. at Govt. School, Nadavannur #kozhikode.

On the 6th of October 2013, Sparsham held an awareness workshop and organ donation drive at C Achyuthamenon Hall, near Ernakulam Public Library, Ernakulam. We collaborated with Kerala Action Force, an organ donation awareness organisation, and they gave a usual speech about organ donation, its benefits, problems, and the business involved. Many people were gathered in the hall, and several questions were discussed. Sparsham gives an organ donor card to those who willing to donate.

> Live your life, then pass it on !

After the high tea, we attended the Annual General Body Meeting (AGM), where we discussed future activities and chose the steering committee for the coming year.

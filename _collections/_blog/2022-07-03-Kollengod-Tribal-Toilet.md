Let's not forget that while we all live in better harmony, there are some marginalized lives among us. Let us try to improve the quality of life of such people at least in a small way.

Puthanpadam tribal village in Kollangode village of Palakkad district is a very backward area. There is not even a single toilet for basic needs in this village where about 100 people live in about 30 houses. It may be unbelievable to many that there is such an area in our country where even basic facilities are inaccessible!

Sparsham Charitable Society has decided to construct two toilets in Puthanpadam tribal village. Full cooperation of all friends is required to make this endeavor a success.

With the hope that through our collective efforts we will be able to provide facilities for basic needs by building toilets in a villege.

Kerala's tribals (Adivasis of Kerala) are the indigenous people of the state of Kerala in southern India. Most of Kerala's indigenous people reside in the forests and mountains of the Western Ghats, which border Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

Kerala's Scheduled Tribe population is 3,64,189 people, according to the 2001 Indian census (lunas - 180,169 and felunas - 184,020). Wayanad has the most tribals (1,36,062). The following two districts, Idukki (50973) and Palakkad (39665), account for the majority of the state's native tribal people groups. The Paniya (Paniyar) are the most populous of the 66 tribes.

Sparsham organised a trip to the tribal settlement to help them by delivering essentials to about 140 families. As we all know, the government has several measures that aid tribal people, but only a small percentage of those who qualify will benefit. In comparison to others, those who receive benefits may have a better life status. Any visitor to a tribal hamlet will be aware of the living circumstances.

A few good-hearted people came forward to speak with them, identify their problems, and present them to the world. We primarily focused on giving educational help at Sparsham, and we had previously visited the tribal communities of Palakkad and Thrissur. We have visited them several occasions and spent time with them, as well as celebrated Onam with them.
